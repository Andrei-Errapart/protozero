#
#  Disabled checks:
#
#  cert-dcl21-cpp
#    It is unclear whether this is still a good recommendation in modern C++.
#
#  cert-err60-cpp
#    Reports std::runtime_error as broken which we can't do anything about.
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-pointer-arithmetic
#    This is a low-level library, it needs to do pointer arithmetic.
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-array-to-pointer-decay
#    Limited use and many false positives including for all asserts
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-reinterpret-cast
#    This is a low-level library, it needs to do reinterpret-casts.
#
#  fuchsia-*
#    Much too strict.
#
#  google-runtime-references
#    This is just a matter of preference, and we can't change the interfaces
#    now anyways.
#
#  hicpp-no-array-decay
#    Limited use and many false positives including for all asserts
